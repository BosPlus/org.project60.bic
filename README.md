Little BIC extension
====================

This extension tries to make generic bank data like name, BIC code, and national bank ID accessible for CiviCRM. The information itself will be downloaded from the various national sources, and can be updated any time.

The extension also offers an API lookup service.

The information will be stored in a new option group.
